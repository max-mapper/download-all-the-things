download all the things!

I wrote this to download all of the youtubes from the documentaries subreddit but its pretty generic and I might add more stuff to it later

It requires node.js and couchdb. kind of a pain to setup -- maybe i'll simplify it in the future! Once you get node and couch installed edit config.json and do `node import-reddit-youtubes` and `node index.js`
